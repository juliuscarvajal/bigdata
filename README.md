# bigdata

Weather Balloon Data Processor
Tested on Mac

Prerequisites:
1. Install nodejs
2. Install mongodb

Steps:
1. Github clone or get zip and unzip to folder
2. cd to folder
3. npm install
4. node logReader.js <--- This will watch the data folder for new files then write to mongodb
5. node --harmony dataGen.js <--- This will generate the dummy data into files.

This is work in progress. I need to resharpen my Nodejs skills so please bear with me. But I am getting the hang of it and within a week or so, I will be up to speed with Nodejs.
