# bigdata

Weather Balloon Data Processor (tested on a Macbook Air)

Prerequisites:<br>
1. Install nodejs<br>
2. Install mongodb<br>

Steps:<br>
1. Github clone or get zip and unzip to folder <br>
2. cd to folder <br>
3. npm install <br>
4. node logReader.js <--- This will watch the data folder for new files then write to mongodb <br>
5. node --harmony dataGen.js <--- This will generate the dummy data into files. <br>

This is work in progress. This big data stuff is really cool it lets me think big in code. Traditional loops won't cut it as it will exceed the stack limit. Recursion + Nodejs' setImmediate to the rescue. Having fun with these new stuff.

I need to resharpen my Nodejs skills so please bear with me. But I am getting the hang of it and within a week or so, I will be up to speed with Nodejs.
