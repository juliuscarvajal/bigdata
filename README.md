# bigdata

Weather Balloon Data Processor (tested on a Macbook Air)

Prerequisites:<br>
1. Install nodejs<br>
2. Install mongodb<br>

Steps:<br>
1. Github clone or get zip and unzip to folder <br>
2. cd to folder <br>
3. npm install <br>
4. node logReader.js <--- This will watch the data folder for new files then write to mongodb <br>
5. node --harmony dataGen.js <--- This will generate the dummy data into files. <br>

This is work in progress. I need to resharpen my Nodejs skills so please bear with me. But I am getting the hang of it and within a week or so, I will be up to speed with Nodejs.
